# ProjectCPlusPlus
 My C++ Project. Feel free to contribute. I am just practicing here

List of files:
 1. YouAreYoung.cpp (works)
 2. CircleSquare.cpp (not working)
 3. BoxerWorld.cpp (off-topic project, to be developed)
 4. CaseFunction1.cpp (not working properly; Homework if24-if27 about cases)
 5. CaseFunction2.cpp (works, but with __IF__ instead of __SWITCH__)
